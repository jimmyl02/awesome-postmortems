# Awesome-Postmortems

Postmortems are writeups posted by engineering organizations when something has gone wrong (incident) and explain the root cause, how they fixed it, and how they are improving systems so that the same issue will not happen again. They are both interesting to read as they provide insight into how large systems work, help engineers avoid the same mistakes, and give customers confidence the issue won't reoccur.

This repository is a simple collection of postmortems I find interesting. Also, it's sometimes hard to find these postmortems (OpenAI for example) so I hope this can also serve as an aggregator. I plan to keep this repository up to date with any new postmortems I find so feel free to make a PR and contribute any articles you find interesting!
